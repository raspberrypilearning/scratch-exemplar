## Hints

Hints in Scratch project often follow this structure:
- textual description of how to solve it
- the blocks which should be used to solve the problem but "jumbled up" e.g. a parsons problem
- the code you need

--- hint ---

Add blocks to your code so that `When the sprite is clicked`{:class="block3events"} it should `say hello for 2 seconds`{:class="block3looks"} before switching to the `next costume`{:class="block3looks"}.

You will need these blocks:

```blocks3
    
say [Hello] for (2) seconds

next costume

when this sprite clicked
```
